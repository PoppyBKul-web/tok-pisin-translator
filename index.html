<p align = "left">In Papua New Guinea, there are about eight hundred different languages spoken across the country. However, tok pisin is more common to all people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<h2>Background of Tok Pisin</h2>
<p align = "left">Tok Pisin, pidgin spoken in Papua New Guinea, hence its identification in some earlier works as New Guinea Pidgin. It was also once called Neo-Melanesian, apparently according to the hypothesis that all English-based Melanesian pidgins developed from the same proto-pidgin. It is one of the three official languages of Papua New Guinea, along with English and Hiri Motu.</p>
<p align = "left">Tok Pisin (literally, “bird talk”) is one of the Pacific pidgins that emerged during the second half of the 19th century on copra and sugarcane plantations to which labour was imported from Melanesia, Malaysia, and China. The extensive multilingualism that resulted called for a lingua franca. People who had traveled to Papua New Guinea from plantations in Samoa and Queensland, Australia, resorted to the pidgin that had developed there, as apparently did those from coastal China. </p>
